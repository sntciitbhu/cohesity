            <h1>What are generic drugs?</h1>
            <p>A generic drug is a medication created to be the same as an already 
            marketed brand-name drug in dosage form, safety, strength, route of 
            administration, quality, performance characteristics, and intended use. 
            These similarities help to demonstrate bioequivalence, which means 
            that a generic medicine works in the same way and provides the same
            clinical benefit as its brand-name version. In other words, you can 
            take a generic medicine as an equal substitute for its brand-name counterpart.</p>

            <h1>Do generic medicines work the same as brand-name medicines?</h1>
            <p>Yes. Any generic medicine modeled after a brand-name medicine must perform the same 
            in the body as the brand-name medicine. This standard applies to all generic medicines. 
            A generic medicine is the same as a brand-name medicine in dosage, safety, effectiveness, 
            strength, stability, and quality, as well as in the way it is taken and the way it should 
            be used. Generic medicines use the same active ingredients as brand-name medicines and work the same way, 
            so they have the same risks and benefits as the brand-name medicines. The FDA Generic Drugs 
            Program conducts a rigorous review to make certain generic medicines meet these standards,
            in addition to conducting 3,500 inspections of manufacturing plants a year and monitoring 
            drug safety after the generic medicine has been approved and brought to market.

            It is important to note that there will always be a slight, 
            but not medically important, level of natural variabilityâ€”just as there is for 
            one batch of brand-name medicine compared with the next batch of brand-name product. This variability 
            can and does occur during manufacturing, for both brand-name and generic medicines. When a medicine, 
            generic or brand-name, is mass produced, very small variations in purity, size, strength, and other 
            parameters are permitted. FDA limits how much variability is acceptable.</p>
