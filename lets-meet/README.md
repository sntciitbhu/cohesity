### Idea
Our idea is to remove the hassle faced during organising and keeping track of meetups and distributing tasks by certain big origanizations. It usually takes a couple of days for the organizations to figure out a perfect slot when all it's members are free. We aim to reduce this wastage of time by automating it using a slack bot as well as a web app.
